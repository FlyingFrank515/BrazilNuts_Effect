# BrazilNuts_Effect(Granular convection)
A physical phenomenon showed by Vpython
## Introduction ##
Granular convection is a phenomenon where granular material subjected to shaking or vibration will exhibit circulation patterns similar to types of fluid convection. It is sometimes described as the Brazil nut effect when the largest particles end up on the surface of a granular material containing a mixture of variously sized objects; this derives from the example of a typical container of mixed nuts, where the largest will be Brazil nuts. The phenomenon is also known as the muesli effect since it is seen in packets of breakfast cereal containing particles of different sizes but similar density, such as muesli mix.

Under experimental conditions, granular convection of variously sized particles has been observed forming convection cells similar to fluid motion. The convection of granular flows is becoming a well-understood phenomenon.

## How it works ##
1. Randomly set the position of big balls and small balls, and let them fall into the container. Also, ensure the position of big balls is relatively close to the bottom.
2. Given the force in random directions and update the position of the balls according to F = ma and the Collision law.
3. Draw the graph of the average position of all big balls. You can find the fact that big balls go higher as time grows.
